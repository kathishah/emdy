# Emdy

A lightweight Markdown reader for macOS.

## Why

AI tools generate a lot of Markdown — project outlines, meeting notes, documentation. When someone outside engineering receives a `.md` file, they're stuck: Quick Look shows raw syntax, and every Markdown app on the market is an editor packed with features they'll never use.

Emdy renders Markdown files as clean, formatted documents. Double-click and read.

## Features

- **GitHub Flavored Markdown** — headings, lists, tables, code blocks, task lists, images, and more
- **File and folder support** — open a single file, or a directory to browse its Markdown files in a sidebar with expandable folders
- **Find in page** — `Cmd F` for incremental search within a document
- **Minimap** — a scaled overview of the document for quick navigation, togglable from the toolbar
- **Syntax highlighting** — language-aware coloring for fenced code blocks
- **Light, Dark, and System themes** — dark mode uses a warm, Braun-inspired palette
- **Optimal reading width** — text stays within a comfortable column, centered in the window
- **Font switcher** — serif (IBM Plex Serif), sans-serif (IBM Plex Sans), or monospace (IBM Plex Mono)
- **Zoom** — enlarge or reduce the document display, with a live percentage readout
- **RTF copy** — copied text pastes formatted into Mail, Google Docs, Slack, etc.
- **Export as PDF** — save directly via a dedicated dialog
- **Print** — via the standard macOS print dialog
- **Native macOS app** — built with Swift and SwiftUI
